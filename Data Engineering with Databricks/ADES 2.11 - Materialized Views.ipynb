Collaborating across teams, data engineers and platform admins can define SLAs to make highly valuable data available to teams in a timely fashion, all while cutting down the potential costs and latency associated with larger ad hoc queries.\n\nIn this notebook, we'll create a gold table that stores summary statistics about each completed workout alongside binned demographic information. In this way, our application can quickly populate statistics about how other users performed on the same workouts.\n\n<img src=\"https://files.training.databricks.com/images/ade/ADE_arch_bpm_summary.png\" width=\"60%\" />\n\n## Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this lesson, students will be able to:\n- Describe performance differences between views and tables\n- Implement a streaming aggregate table"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"1faadc4e-e014-49eb-80f1-ed5b6cae7eb2"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Set up path and checkpoint variables (these will be used later)."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"f2145dc0-fe9e-48ca-b076-83cdca37b9e7"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%run ../Includes/gold-setup"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"c060d5f2-c038-4d89-bb83-37d0375eaf30"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["A helper function has been defined to process a new batch of data to the source tables used in this lesson.
