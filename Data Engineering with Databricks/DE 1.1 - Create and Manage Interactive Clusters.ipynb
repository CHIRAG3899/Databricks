You run these workloads as a set of commands in a notebook or as an automated job. \n\nDatabricks makes a distinction between all-purpose clusters and job clusters. \n- You use all-purpose clusters to analyze data collaboratively using interactive notebooks.\n- You use job clusters to run fast and robust automated jobs.\n\nThis demo will cover creating and managing all-purpose Databricks clusters using the Databricks Data Science & Engineering Workspace. \n\n## Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this lesson, you should be able to:\n* Use the Clusters UI to configure and deploy a cluster\n* Edit, terminate, restart, and delete clusters"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"dce247b6-cc9e-4772-a43e-446ebbefe814"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Create Cluster\n\nDepending on the workspace in which you're currently working, you may or may not have cluster creation privileges. \n\nInstructions in this section assume that you **do** have cluster creation privileges, and that you need to deploy a new cluster to execute the lessons in this course.\n\n**NOTE**: Check with your instructor or a platform admin to confirm whether or not you should create a new cluster or connect to a cluster that has already been deployed. Cluster policies may impact your options for cluster configuration. \n\nSteps:\n1. Use the left sidebar to navigate to the **Compute** page by clicking on the ![compute](https://files.training.databricks.com/images/clusters-icon.png) icon\n1. Click the blue **Create Cluster** button\n1. For the **Cluster name**, use your name so that you can find it easily and the instructor can easily identify it if you have problems\n1. Set the **Cluster mode** to **Single Node** (this mode is required to run this course)\n1. Use the recommended **Databricks runtime version** for this course\n1. Leave boxes checked for the default settings under the **Autopilot Options**\n1. Click the blue **Create Cluster** button\n\n**NOTE:** Clusters can take several minutes to deploy.

(Clusters will also terminate automatically due to inactivity assuming this setting is used.)\n\nWhen a cluster terminates, all cloud resources currently in use are deleted. This means:\n* Associated VMs and operational memory will be purged\n* Attached volume storage will be deleted\n* Network connections between nodes will be removed\n\nIn short, all resources previously associated with the compute environment will be completely removed. This means that **any results that need to be persisted should be saved to a permanent location**. Note that you will not lose your code, nor will you lose data files that you've saved out appropriately.\n\nThe **Restart** button will allow us to manually restart our cluster. This can be useful if we need to completely clear out the cache on the cluster or wish to completely reset our compute environment.\n\nThe **Terminate** button allows us to stop our cluster. We maintain our cluster configuration setting, and can use the **Restart** button to deploy a new set of cloud resources using the same configuration.\n\nThe **Delete** button will stop our cluster and remove the cluster configuration."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"3f80bef3-52c2-45c3-b7d6-12885fd3fa89"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["-sandbox\n&copy; 2022 Databricks, Inc.
