Now we'll explore the contents of this notebook to better understand the syntax used by Delta Live Tables.\n\nThis notebook uses SQL to declare Delta Live Tables that together implement a simple multi-hop architecture based on a Databricks-provided example dataset loaded by default into Databricks workspaces.\n\nAt its simplest, you can think of DLT SQL as a slight modification to traditional CTAS statements. DLT tables and views will always be preceded by the **`LIVE`** keyword.\n\n## Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this lesson, you should be able to:\n* Define tables and views with Delta Live Tables\n* Use SQL to incrementally ingest raw data with Auto Loader\n* Perform incremental reads on Delta tables with SQL\n* Update code and redeploy a pipeline"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"6ad26392-32f9-4df1-8deb-ed36ab88ebbb"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Declare Bronze Layer Tables\n\nBelow we declare two tables implementing the bronze layer.

Similar in function to a traditional **`WHERE`** clause, **`CONSTRAINT`** integrates with DLT, enabling it to collect metrics on constraint violations. Constraints provide an optional **`ON VIOLATION`** clause, specifying an action to take on records that violate the constraint. The three modes currently supported by DLT include:\n\n| **`ON VIOLATION`** | Behavior |\n| --- | --- |\n| **`FAIL UPDATE`** | Pipeline failure when constraint is violated |\n| **`DROP ROW`** | Discard records that violate constraints |\n| Omitted | Records violating constraints will be included (but violations will be reported in metrics) |\n\n#### References to DLT Tables and Views\nReferences to other DLT tables and views will always include the **`live.`** prefix. A target database name will automatically be substituted at runtime, allowing for easily migration of pipelines between DEV/QA/PROD environments.\n\n#### References to Streaming Tables\n\nReferences to streaming DLT tables use the **`STREAM()`**, supplying the table name as an argument."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"a5c7092c-23b4-4ce4-8ef7-60ce95f8ceaf"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%sql\nCREATE OR REFRESH STREAMING LIVE TABLE sales_orders_cleaned(\n  CONSTRAINT valid_order_number EXPECT (order_number IS NOT NULL) ON VIOLATION DROP ROW\n)\nCOMMENT \"The cleaned sales orders with valid order_number(s) and partitioned by order_datetime.\"\nAS\n  SELECT f.customer_id, f.customer_name, f.number_of_line_items, \n         timestamp(from_unixtime((cast(f.order_datetime as long)))) as order_datetime, \n         date(from_unixtime((cast(f.order_datetime as long)))) as order_date, \n         f.order_number, f.ordered_products, c.state, c.city, c.lon, c.lat, c.units_purchased, c.loyalty_segment\n  FROM STREAM(LIVE.sales_orders_raw) f\n  LEFT JOIN LIVE.customers c\n    ON c.customer_id = f.customer_id\n    AND c.customer_name = f.customer_name"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"8b38195b-ac9f-4f4a-b203-31efd0b257cc"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Declare Gold Table\n\nAt the most refined level of the architecture, we declare a table delivering an aggregation with business value, in this case a collection of sales order data based in a specific region.
